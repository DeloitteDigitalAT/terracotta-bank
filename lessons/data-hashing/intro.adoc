Terracotta logs the session id to the logs. This makes it vulnerable
to session hijacking to anyone with access to the logs. Oftentimes,
logs are available to every engineer at the company, which turns this
into a confidentiality risk.

Try using the logs to hijack a user's session. Carefully examine the
format to determine your course of action.

For information on how to exploit or mitigate this risk, and learn a bit
about Java's hashing API along the way, check out the following lesson:

```bash
./checkout-lesson.sh data-hashing
