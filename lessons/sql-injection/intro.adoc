Terracotta has a number of places where it is vulnerable to SQL Injection.
Having multiple vulnerable endpoints gives you an opportunity to practice penetration and mitigation multiple times.

To discover vulnerable endpoints, try using http://sqlmap.org/[sqlmap].
Or simply try using common SQL injection techniques against all the forms in the application.

If you get stuck, check out the unit tests in Terracotta for ideas.

Or, also try reviewing the `sql-injection` mitigation track by doing:

```bash
./checkout-lesson.sh sql-injection
```
